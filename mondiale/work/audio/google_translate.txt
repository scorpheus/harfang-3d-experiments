If the dark knocks the window of the blue moon
Open up treasure chest alone and make a night love sentence

I'm sure it will be tomorrow morning
I will throw it all away
I'm sure it will be tomorrow morning
I will throw it all away

Should I step from the right or left foot
I have a head holding my head

Gathering one and two memories in the dark
Frozen night sky melody that holds eyes closed and sits

Even if tomorrow night came
All follow the same path
Even if tomorrow night came
All follow the same path

A game between imagination and delusions
An example of a simple and concise solution
